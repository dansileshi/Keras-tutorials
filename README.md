# Keras-tutorials

The purpose of these notes was for me to get to know <a href="http://keras.io">Keras</a>, having previously used <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a> (which is messy) and <a href="http://torch.ch">Torch</a> (which is much nicer, but written in Lua).

My aim is:

1. <a href="https://github.com/box121209/Keras-tutorials/blob/master/1_getting_started.ipynb">Getting started</a>: to explore the most elementary models with synthetic data.
2. <a href="https://github.com/box121209/Keras-tutorials/blob/master/2_playing_with_MNIST.ipynb">Playing with MNIST</a>: to compare classifiers and demonstrate some visualisations.
3. <a href="https://github.com/box121209/Keras-tutorials/blob/master/3_playing_with_sequences.ipynb">Playing with sequences</a>: to explore the use of Keras on LSTM-based recurrent networks.

Hope they're of help to others, and I'd welcome comments.
